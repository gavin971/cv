Matt Terry is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, where he is involved in inertial confinement fusion
reasearch and tries to design evey more clever ways to blow things up with
lasers and ion beams.  Along the way, he has aquired an interest in automation
and the optimization of poorly defined problems. While working on his PhD in
