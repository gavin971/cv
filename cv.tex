\subsection*{The Hacker Within}
The Hacker Within (THW) is a student-led, skill sharing interest group for
scientific software development.  It was founded in 2008 by two colleagues and
myself.  THW holds regular meetings organized around discussion of software
development.  I personally contributed talks on build systems (CMake), version
control (Subversion, Mercurial), text editors (VIM), and many Python-related
topics.

\vspace{0.1in}

THW also hosts occasional highly focused multi-day ``boot camp'' workshops. I
helped organize and teach boot camps on Unix literacy, C++, and Python in 2008,
2009, and 2010.  The Python boot camp, in particular, had more than 70 attendees
from 20 departments and included more than 18 hours of instruction.  In
addition to organization, I was responsible for teaching the sessions
``Modules, Scripts, Packages and Classes,''  ``Graphing with MatPlotLib,''
``Extending Python with C/C++ using SWIG,''  and ``Batteries Included - The
Python Standard Library.''

\subsection*{Software Carpentry}
Software Carpentry seeks to make scientists more effective by teaching them
basic computing skills.  They have adopted the THW-style boot camp teaching
methodology and have, over the past two years, taught over 50 workshops in the
US, Canada, and Europe.  I have assisted with several Software Carpentry
workshops at UC-Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.  I am currently
participating in a Software Carpentry instructor training course covering the
academic literature on effective software development practice and techniques
for effective computing instruction.

\subsection*{Engineering Problem Solving}
At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I was a Teaching Assistant for NE 271:
Engineering Problem Solving.  This laboratory course covers the solution of engineering
problems using commercially-available software tools (spreadsheets, symbolic
manipulators, and equation solvers). The emphasis of the course is on nuclear
engineering problems, including radioactive decay, nuclear cross sections,
scattering, and criticality.  In this freshmen-level class, I was responsible
for guiding the in-class exercises as well as real-time debugging of students'
programming errors and computing misconceptions.


\section*{Scientific Research}
\hrule
\vspace{0.07in}

\subsection*{Post-Doctoral Research}
My post-doctoral research has focused on understanding the physics of objects
subjected to extremely high power ($10^{14}$ W), high intensity ($10^{15}
\text{W}/\text{cm}^2$) laser and particle beams.  My research in the field of
high energy density physics has focused on two broad topics: design of systems
oriented at producing laboratory thermonuclear fusion, and design and analysis
of materials science experiments involving metals at high pressure ($10^5$ - $5
\cdot 10^6$ times atmospheric pressure).

\vspace{0.1in}

My fusion efforts have all occurred in the field of inertial confinement
fusion (ICF), a potential means of energy production that uses
micro-explosions to produce conditions with densities 100,000 times solid
density and temperatures in excess of $10^8$ K.  I developed a shock ignition
target compatible with ``day one'' hardware on the recently completed National
Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, CA\@.  The design includes an assessment
of energetics, hydrodynamic stability, and performance degradation due to
experimental jitter and hot electrons.

\vspace{0.1in}

Additionally, I developed another ICF concept that uses directly incident ion
beams to drive an ICF implosion.  This design makes use of the long range
deposition of heavy ion beams and uses tamped ablation to achieve high
efficiency.  My work has progressed into the design of laser driven
hydrodynamics experiments that test the physics of shear flow
relevant to the recently developed X-target ICF concept.

\vspace{0.1in}

My work in materials science experiments focuses on developing
experiments on two high power laser systems: NIF (Livermore, CA) and Omega
(Rochester, NY).  These experiments are intended to measure the material
properties of metals under high pressure ($10^5 - 5 \cdot 10^6$ times atmospheric
pressure).  I have helped design, specify, and analyze successful
experiments over a broad range of conditions.  Experiments include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item measurement of the crystalline structure of thin (5 micron)
		Tantalum foils while subjected to 300 kBar shocks
	\item testing of a high energy (22 keV) silver x-ray backlighter intended for
		radiography of Tantalum under high pressure (~5 MBar)
	\item measurement of the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor unstable
		perturbations subject to a ramped pressure drive
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Ph.D. Research}
My Ph.D. research studied the effect of different charged particle stopping
power models on the performance of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets.
Much work went into the development of a library (``Deeks'') that implements
many different models and does extensive consistency checking between the model
and the conditions to which it is applied.  This library has been incorporated
into the pre-existing time dependent charged particle tracking package (a Monte
Carlo-like transport scheme) in an existing multi-physics code (``Bucky'').
This allows me to examine the effect of different transport models
in integrated realistic simulations.

\vspace{0.1in}

More specifically, my research involved studying the effect that collision operators have on transport properties of the plasma.  Due to the particularly high densities of ICF plasmas, this requires a careful, combined treatment of both the collisional and dielectric properties of the plasma.  One effective treatment is the use of so-called ``convergent'' kinetic theories that carefully cancel opposing divergences in collisional and dielectric treatments.  I have implemented stopping power models by 
Landau; 
Spitzer; 
Jackson; 
Brysk; 
Skupsky; 
Kihara and Aono; 
May and Cramer; 
Li and Petrasso; 
and 
Brown, Preston, and Singleton%
.
In my own research, I have derived and implemented Fermi-degenerate extensions of the Landau and Li and Petrasso models.  
%I am currently composing papers for publication on my Fermi-degenerate extension work and another on my analysis of the applicability of existing stopping power models in ICF ignition experiments.

\section*{Relevant Skills and Experience}
\hrule
\vspace{0.07in}

\subsection*{Software Development}
Over the course of my research, I have developed a significant amount of
scientific software.  I am a skilled Python developer, with 8 years of
experience with NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Cython, PyTables, etc.  I am
proficient in Fortran, C, and C++ and have experience working in parallel
environments.  I am a vim, git, and \LaTeX user and am at home with the
command-line.

The computing aspect of my Ph.D. research required the integration of a library
written in C++ (Deeks) with an existing Fortran program (Bucky).  Data analysis
in compiled languages is overly time intensive, so I developed Python
interfaces to both codes.  The flexibility provided by the Python interface
enabled the rapid development of an automatic shock tuner for Bucky.  The tuner
completely automates a previously labor and analysis intensive process.  What
once took a week, can now be accomplished in hours.


\subsection*{Grant and Proposal Writing}
I am the LLNL Primary Investigator for a 3-year, \$6M proposal the US DoE
Office of Science to.  The proposal seeks funding to  experimentally investigate
the physics of shock reflection and the evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in conditions relevant to an ion driven fusion energy target
design.  If funded, I would be responsible for directing as \$1.1M in funds
over three years and managing a group of senior research scientists.  The
proposal is in collaboration with scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory.


\subsection*{Scientific Programming in Python Program Committee 2012-2013}
