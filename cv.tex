\section*{Objective}
\sectionline
I am seeking a position employing computational tools in the analysis and
solution of scientific and technical problems.  I am a US citizen and currently
hold a Department of Energy ``Q'' clearance.

\section*{Computational Physicist Engineer}
\sectionline
I am by temperament an engineer, by training a physicist, and by practice a
software developer.  For the last 9 years, my research has focused on using
practical
computational methods to model and understand the behavior of high energy
density plasmas, that is, ionized matter with pressure greater than $10^6$ times atmospheric
pressure and temperatures exceeding $10^4$ K.  I have studied in detail, shock hydrodynamics,
fusion burn kinetics, and inertial fusion design.

Intrinsic to my scientific research is the development of software.  Among my
software projects I have:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Developed Monte Carlo charged particle transport packages for two
		radiation hydrodynamics codes ``Bucky'' and ``Draco''.  These were
		developed to study the physics of fusion burn kinetics in high density
		plasmas.
	\item Developed a platform to automate the design of certain aspect of an
		inertial fusion target design.  It uses parallel optimization
		techniques to optimize laser timing and intensity features.  In
		practice, multiple-day exercise are replaced by a single 4 hour batch
		job.
\end{enumerate}

I am conversant in numerical methods for solving partial differential.
I have significant experience with Lagrangian hydrodynamics, Monte Carlo
solutions to the Boltzmann Equation, and compatible finite different
methods.  I am interested in large scale numerical
optimization, especially techniques using concurrent function evaluations.


\section*{High Performance Python Expert}
\sectionline
I have been developing scientific software for more than a decade and Python
for nearly 9 years.  I have experience running Python in parallel environments
on large computing clusters and am comfortable processing ``big data''.  My
scientific analysis tools are all developed in Python and make extensive use of
the NumPy/SciPy ecosystem as well as interfacing with external code/libraries
when appropriate.  I have extensive experience developing convenient Python
interfaces to high performance, compiled libraries using tools such as Cython,
f2py, and SWIG.

Among my Python projects I have:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Developed an analysis library for pre-processing, post-processing,
		and embedded steering of the radiation-hydrodynamics program HYDRA.
	\item Currently developing a program ``Yoink'' to reverse-engineering data
		from scientific figures.
	\item Converted a rigid legacy Fortran program to a script-able
		Python-based program without significant loss of performance.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to Python, I have worked with C, C++, Fortran (legacy Fortran 77
and modern Fortran 90+), and Go.  I am a vim, git, and \LaTeX user and am at
home with the command-line.


\section*{Scientific Computing Community Advocate}
\sectionline
I am an advocate for computing competency in the sciences.  While in graduate
school, I helped found The Hacker Within, a peer learning group for scientific
computing and open source tools.  Additionally, I teach scientists software
development skills as an instructor with  Software Carpentry.

I am an active member of the Python scientific computing community.   As a
member of the program committee, I helped set the program for the Scientific
Computing in Python conference.  I am a member of the UC-Berkely py4science
community and a member of NumFocus, a Python oriented scientific
computing advocacy organization.
