My name is Matt Terry and this is my CV.

I'm interested in high energy density physics, inertial confinement fusion,
fusion particle transport, and thermonuclear burn.  I have a great love for
Python, particularly as it relates to scientific programming.  I am founding
member of the Hacker Within and an advocate for basic computing literacy for
all scientists.
